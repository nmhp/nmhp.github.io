In search for a way to alleviate my pain I embrace all opportunities for helping people to pass through their sufferings. As a kid who was born in a low-income family I've always been intrigued by the discussions about fairness, mobility and opportunity. I think that facing with different kinds of economic insecurity and social exclusion throughout my upbringing has provided me lived experiences of inequality and discrimination. I feel like I'm asked by these experiences to attain real insights on the hegemonic discourse of poverty and inequality and different channels-socail expectation, stereotypes, mental state- through them it makes harder to go up the ladder of income and status in modern world.
